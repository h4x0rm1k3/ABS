Chrome & Firefox extensions removed, only available via Git now. This version is specifically to counter the accounts that end up at the URL with /?redref=amc at the end. As far as I can tell this will also work for accounts that don't have this problem as it's still a valid rewards URL so this should be universal.

To Install this extension in Chrome go in to Extensions, turn on Developer mode with the toggle in top right corner and then in the left corner click on load unpacked and point it to the src folder. As for Firefox you'll need to make a developer account with Firefox developer here - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/ and follow the guide here - https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/publish/submitting-an-add-on/, upload the files to get it signed (make sure to select for personal use, on your own only and DON'T publish it for all to download else it'll probably end up getting banned again) and in a short while you'll receive an email stating it's been created and you can return back to developer menu to download the .xpi file to install it manually in Firefox as normal.
